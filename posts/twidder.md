### CSS, not so much
While developing my app, I learned that I really truly enjoy design and the careful considerations that go into making beautiful, flexible, intelligent design. I love the intersection of code and art, and making a piece of software feel intuitive. I spent hours poring over how big certain words should be, which font to use, where things should be aligned. Much like any other type of development, I felt like my work was never finished. There was always another consideration, another way to do something, another way to make it prettier. 

As part of the program, we developed a twitter clone, and I felt the fire reigniting. It is such a joy to spend hours perfecting the little details of something, only to have it turn out beautifully. From splash screens to animations to pure back-end code, I felt that the choices I made coalesced into something fun to interact with as well as fun to look at. Not to mention, using jQuery to create animations is worlds easier than a purely CSS driven route.
