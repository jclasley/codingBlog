### Recursion is weird
Prior to starting this course, I thought myself a relatively seasoned developer, capable of doing all sorts of tasks. Prior to starting this course, I had never heard of recursion.

It took many, many attempts to wrap my head around the recursive `return` statements. What the **hell** was going on? I voiced my issues with a fellow pre-course classmate, with whom I had developed a friendly rapport (and who was way smarter than me). Thank god I did, because his response saved me likely hours of headache trying to understand the concept. *"Recursion is just iterating using the stack instead of an iterator."*

I thought, "Surely it's not that simple." It is. It is that simple. Things began clicking into place, and I was able to accomplish the tasks set out. However, I'm still working on re-implementing the `JSON.parse` function, and it has not been fun. Still learning all about _recursive descent parsers_ and what that actually means. Check in later to see any progress updates.

- ✅ Reimplement `getElementsByClassName`
- ✅ Reimplement `JSON.stringify`
- ⬜ Reimplement `JSON.parse`
